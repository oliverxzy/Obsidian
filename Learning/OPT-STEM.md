### Change job update
```
Hello Zhengyang,

You and your new employer will need to complete an I-983 Training Plan and you will need to send it to us with information about your new employment so that we can add this information to your SEVIS record.  You can use the STEM Extension Students Info Update form https://students.syr.edu/machform/view.php?id=29582 to send us a copy of the I-983 and information about your new employment.   Please try to take care of this as soon as possible so that we can update your SEVIS record.

You and your previous employer should also complete and send to us the final evaluation of the I-983 Training Plan that you completed when you applied for STEM Extension OPT.

Thank you.

Cathy
