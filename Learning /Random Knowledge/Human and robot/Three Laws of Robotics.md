**First Law**
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
**Second Law**
robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
**Third Law**
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

阿西莫夫后来写道，他不应该因为创造了这些法律而受到赞扬，因为它们“从一开始就很明显，每个人都下意识地意识到它们。在我成功完成这项工作之前，这些法律从未碰巧被写成简短的句子。当然，这些法则适用于人类使用的每一种工具”, 并且“几乎所有工具的设计中都隐含了这些法则的类似物，无论是否是机器人”

Asimov himself believed that his Three Laws became the basis for a new view of robots which moved beyond the "[[Frankenstein complex]]". His view that robots are more than mechanical monsters eventually spread throughout science fiction
