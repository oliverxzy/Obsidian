#### 11:17 - 15:07
`=(date(2022-11-10T15:07)-date(2022-11-10T11:17))`
- Completed [[142. Linked List Cycle II]]
    -   set slow = slow.next, fast = fast.next.next. Find two pointer's meeting point
    -   move one of them to head, slow = slow.next, fast = fast.next
        -   when they meet, the point is start of cycle
